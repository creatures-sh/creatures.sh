  ask? It's like strapping a rocket to your code. It taps into the JavaScript
  Core engine from Safari, optimized for lightning-quick startup times. And
  here's the kicker—it's built in Zig, a programming language that knows how to
  tackle performance bottlenecks. So your code runs at warp speed.

  like reading and writing to the file system. You know those tasks that used to
  be a chore? With Bun, they're a breeze. More speed, less effort.

- **Lightning-Fast Package Manager:** Wait, there's more! Bun comes with a
  standalone package manager that's not just fast; it's up to 25 times faster
  than npm. Say goodbye to waiting around for packages to install—Bun gets you
  back to coding in no time.
